# [Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate)
### Not,  And, Or, Nand,  Nor
These logic components are implemented using the cpp logic functions. A single Nand or Nor gate would be sufficient to create all the other gates. But this is somewhat faster.
### Xor
The xor gate is created using a or, nand and and gate.

### Xnor
This gate is created by adding a not gate at the end of the xor gate.
